  							<li>The proportion of delayed flights has been at its lowest in recent years. But there has been two or three incidents of significant increases in the proportion of delayed flights for all the airports included in this study.</li>
  							<li>In case of Chicago O'Hare, the decrease in the proportion of delayed flights can be attributed to the decrease in traffic as there is almost 1:1 correspondence between the two metric as exhibited in the two plots above.</li>
  							<li>For Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, the proportion of delayed flights has reduced significantly in recent years which can be attributed to the improvements and renovations that happened between 2001 and 2014 and is well documented on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport" target="blank"> Wikipedia </a>.</li>
  							<li>In case of Denver airport, the proportion of delayed traffic has been fairly constant but the average number of monthly arrivals has steadily increased. This has been possible due to the addition of the sixth runway which was commissioned in <a href="http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/denver/" target="blank">2003</a>.</li>

  							<li>The proportion of delayed flights reach their maximum during the summer and winter seasons. However, when the proportion of delay (time) is taken into account, the summer season proves to be the worst performing season.</li>
  							<li>The increased proportion of delayed flights and delays during the summer season can be attributed to the higher volume of flight arrivals during the summer season. The summer season had the highest monthly flight arrivals for 12 out of 12 years included in this study.</li>
  							<li>P.S. > The flight statistics from 2003 and 2016 were ignored when analyzing the seasonal nature of the delay due to lack of data for certain months.</li>
